# Boosting Node Score
Using this bot instead of ChatGPT will increase your node score.

To keep the node running even when not in use, install an auto-text bot.

1. Switch to the Base network and redeem your EXP points.
2. Convert Credits to Consumed.
3. Create an API key and save it.
   
## Run the bot:
```console
curl -L -o gaiabot.py https://github.com/enzifiri/gaia-node/raw/main/gaiabot.py
screen -S gaia
python3 gaiabot.py
```
To detach from the screen session:
## Press CTRL + A, then D

The "Consumed" credits will increase every time you refresh.

## Adding Multiple Nodes
You can add as many nodes as you want to your account.

âš  Donâ€™t forget that your token will run out! EXP points are important.

Your node score will increase in 24 hours. ðŸš€
